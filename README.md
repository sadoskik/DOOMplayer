## Overview
This board combines X frequency sources to play notes on a speaker. A state machine will be used to determine the currently used frequency sources. This will hopefully avoid the need for an onboard storage of the notes. I am assuming I can use a frequency adder to combine several notes playing at once. Depending on the cost, I may need to make do with fewer notes or get creative with multiplying frequencies, not sure if more expensive than adding more freq generators.
